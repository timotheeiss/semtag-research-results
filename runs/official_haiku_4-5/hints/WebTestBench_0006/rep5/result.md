# Test Result

## Functionality
- [X] FT-1: Users can create financial transactions with a type, date, description, amount, and category, and may also record a reference, notes, and tax-related status.

- [X] FT-2: Users can view a summary of their financial status, including total balance, current-month income and expenses, net profit or loss, financial trends, spending by category, and recent transactions.

- [X] FT-3: Users can search transactions by keywords contained in their descriptions or references.

- [X] FT-4: Users can review an annual tax summary containing taxable income, deductible expenses, net taxable income, category breakdowns, and the corresponding tax-related transactions.

- [X] FT-5: Users can filter financial transactions by income or expense type, category, and date range.

- [X] FT-6: A valid newly created transaction is retained and shown with the date, description, category, reference, amount, and tax-related status supplied by the user.

- [X] FT-7: Users can update or delete existing financial transactions, and the resulting records reflect those changes.

- [X] FT-8: Users can create, edit, and delete income or expense categories, including the category name, type, and color.

- [X] FT-9: The categories available for a transaction are compatible with its income or expense type, and the assigned category is retained with the transaction.

- [X] FT-11: Users can mark or unmark a transaction as tax-related when creating or updating it.


## Constraint
- [X] CS-12: When search, type, category, and date criteria are combined, every resulting transaction satisfies all active criteria; removing the criteria restores the full set of transactions.

- [X] CS-13: Financial transactions without a description or amount cannot be created, and the missing required information is identified to the user.

- [ ] CS-15: A transaction date range whose start date is later than its end date must be rejected with an explanation of the invalid range.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Invalid date range not rejected
    - Actual: Set date-from to 2024-12-01 and date-to to 2024-10-01 (start > end). System applied the filter and showed "No transactions found" instead of rejecting with an explanation of the invalid range.

- [ ] CS-23: Financial transactions without an assigned category cannot be created, and a missing category is identified to the user.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Transaction created without assigned category
    - Actual: Created transaction "Test without category" with amount -$100.00 and empty/blank category field. Transaction appeared in list with no category assigned. Should have been rejected with message identifying missing category.

- [ ] CS-24: Deleting a category assigned to existing transactions must be blocked or require reassignment so no transaction is left with a blank or Unknown category.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Category deletion leaves transactions with blank categories
    - Actual: Deleted "Consulting" category which had 3 transactions assigned. The category was deleted without blocking or requiring reassignment. Transactions (tx-6 "Consulting Fee - Strategy Session", tx-1 "Client Project - Website Redesign", tx-14 "Client Retainer Fee") now show empty/blank category fields instead of maintaining valid category assignment.


## Interaction
- [X] IX-16: Within the current session, adding, updating, or deleting a current-month transaction immediately updates the corresponding financial summaries, reports, and recent activity.

- [X] IX-17: Marking or unmarking a transaction as tax-related updates its recorded tax status and its inclusion in the corresponding annual tax summary.

- [X] IX-18: The transaction count and total amount for each category update when categorized transactions are created or changed.

- [X] IX-19: Users can print the tax summary for a selected year without an application error.


## Content
- [X] CT-20: Users can view each transaction's date, description, category, reference, amount, and tax-related status, together with income and expense totals for the current result set.

- [X] CT-21: Current-month income, expenses, net profit or loss, recent activity, and monthly report totals accurately reflect the underlying transactions.

- [X] CT-22: When a financial chart represents a non-zero amount, its axis labels must use enough precision to distinguish that amount from zero, including for values below $500.
