# Test Result

## Functionality
- [X] FT-1: Employers can publish a job listing with a title, industry, employment type, location, valid salary range, description, and required skills; the new listing appears in the employer dashboard and the job-seeker listing.

- [X] FT-2: Employers can delete one of their posted jobs only after confirming the action; the job and its applications are then removed from the employer dashboard and the job-seeker listing.

- [X] FT-3: The employer dashboard lists all active jobs posted by the current employer and shows accurate active-job and total-application counts.

- [X] FT-4: The employer dashboard lets the employer open each posted job's application list and view the applications associated with that job.

- [X] FT-5: Job seekers can browse the complete list of available jobs see an accurate result count and open any listing to view its details.

- [X] FT-6: Job seekers can filter listings by industry, location, and employment type individually or in combination; clearing the criteria restores the full list.

- [X] FT-7: Keyword search matches job titles, company names, and required skills without case sensitivity and immediately updates the visible results and count.

- [X] FT-8: On a job details page, a job seeker can submit an application with a name, syntactically valid email address, optional phone number, and message and receives a clear success confirmation.

- [ ] FT-18: Employers can edit the details of a published job and the updated information is reflected in both employer and job-seeker views.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: No edit functionality found
    - Actual: No edit buttons or links found on employer dashboard or job detail pages. Application does not provide ability to edit job details after posting. Feature appears not to be implemented.


## Constraint
- [X] CS-9: A job application cannot be submitted when the required name email or message is missing or when the email syntax is invalid; the invalid field is identified to the user.

- [ ] CS-10: A job cannot be published until its title, industry, employment type, location, description, salary range, and at least one required skill are provided; the salary values must be non-negative with the minimum no greater than the maximum, and invalid data produces clear feedback.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Invalid salary range accepted and published
    - Actual: Job creation allowed with minimum salary (100000) greater than maximum salary (50000). Job displayed as "$100k - $50k" in both employer dashboard and job seeker listing. No validation error or clear feedback provided to employer about invalid salary range.

- [ ] CS-11: A job seeker cannot submit another application for the same job using an email address already used for that job; the existing application remains unchanged.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Duplicate applications accepted with same email
    - Actual: Submitted second application for Senior Python Developer job using jane.smith@example.com (email already used for first application to same job). Application was accepted and success notification was shown. No validation prevented duplicate applications.


## Interaction
- [X] IX-13: A successfully submitted application produces visible confirmation and appears exactly once under the matching job in the employer dashboard with the submitted information.

- [X] IX-14: Changing search or filter criteria immediately refreshes the matching jobs and result count including the no-results state; clearing all criteria restores the full list.

- [ ] IX-19: Published jobs, submitted applications, and job deletions remain in effect after the page is reloaded.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Published job lost after page reload
    - Actual: Before reload: 6 active jobs, 4 total applications, Senior Python Developer job visible in both job seeker and employer dashboard. After page reload: 5 active jobs, 3 total applications, Senior Python Developer job disappeared from both listings. Newly published jobs are not persisted across page reloads. Job deletion appears persistent, but job creation is not.


## Content

- [X] CT-16: A job details page displays information matching the selected listing: title, company, industry, employment type, location, salary range, posting date, full description, and required skills.

- [X] CT-17: For each application, the employer can view the applicant's name, email address, optional phone number, message, and submission date as a distinct record.

- [X] CT-20: Newly published jobs and newly submitted applications display an accurate submission date relative to the user's current date.
