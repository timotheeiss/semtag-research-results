# Test Result

## Functionality
- [X] FT-1: Sellers can create a listing by attaching one or more of their own product photos and supplying a title, description, non-negative price, category, condition, location, and upcycled status; the created listing retains and displays the submitted information.

- [ ] FT-2: Sellers can edit the title, description, photos, price, category, condition, location, and upcycled status of an existing listing they own, and the saved listing displays the changes.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Edit functionality not implemented
    - Actual: Reviewed My Listings page and product detail page for listing I created. No Edit button or option found. Only View, Mark Sold, and Delete actions available for sellers.

- [X] FT-3: Sellers can mark an owned listing as sold or available and can delete it after confirmation; their listing view immediately reflects the resulting status or removal.

- [X] FT-4: A listing marked sold or deleted is no longer offered to buyers in browse results and cannot be newly added to a cart or used to start a purchase request.

- [X] FT-5: A user can register with a name, unique valid email address, password of at least six characters, and location; successful registration is confirmed and leaves the new user signed in.

- [X] FT-6: Buyers can combine category, minimum and maximum price, condition, distance, and upcycled-only filters and sort the available listings by newest, price, or distance; every result satisfies all active criteria.

- [X] FT-7: Buyers can search available listings case-insensitively by words in the title, description, or location; every result matches the query, and clearing it restores the unsearched result set.

- [X] FT-8: A signed-in buyer can add an available listing they do not own to the cart; the item is retained once with its title, photo, location, and price, and the cart total is correct.

- [ ] FT-9: A signed-in buyer can submit a non-empty purchase-request message for an available listing they do not own and receives visible confirmation that it was submitted.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Missing visible confirmation after submission
    - Actual: Submitted purchase request message 'Hi, is this still available? I'm very interested in purchasing it.' via Message Seller dialog. Dialog closed indicating submission, but no visible confirmation message was displayed to confirm the request was sent.

- [ ] FT-21: Choosing a category from the category-browsing page opens browse results containing only available listings in that category and shows a matching result count.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Category filter not applied from category browsing page
    - Actual: Clicked 'Furniture' category from categories page. URL changed to ?category=furniture, but results still showed all 10 items instead of filtered 3 Furniture items. Category filter toggle was not checked in results view.

- [ ] FT-22: After a buyer submits a purchase request, the relevant seller can view the requested item and buyer message, and a cart request is reported as sent only after a request has been recorded for each cart item.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Cannot verify seller notification and cart status indication
    - Actual: Submitted purchase request message via Message Seller dialog and cart checkout. Cart was cleared after checkout (suggesting request was processed), but could not verify: (1) seller can view the request, (2) message is visible to seller, or (3) cart status shows 'sent' confirmation.


## Constraint
- [X] CS-10: A login attempt using an email that is not registered is rejected and does not create an authenticated session.

- [X] CS-11: Registration rejects an email already used by an account, including a case-only variation, without replacing the existing account.

- [ ] CS-12: A registered account can be authenticated only with its correct password; an incorrect password is rejected without creating a signed-in session.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Password validation not enforced
    - Actual: Login with bob.johnson@example.com and incorrect password 'wrongpassword123' succeeded and created authenticated session. User was able to log in without correct password.

- [X] CS-13: Seller-management actions are available only for listings owned by the signed-in seller and are not exposed when that user views another seller's listing.

- [ ] CS-14: A listing cannot be created without at least one photo, a title, description, valid price, category, condition, and location, and the missing required information is identified to the seller.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Photos not required despite specification
    - Actual: Successfully created 'Vintage Oak Desk' listing without uploading any photos. Per CS-14, listing cannot be created without at least one photo, but the application allowed creation.

- [X] CS-15: A listing price must be a finite number greater than or equal to zero; negative or non-numeric prices are rejected without creating the listing.

- [X] CS-23: Creating or managing listings, adding items to or viewing the cart, and submitting purchase requests require a signed-in account; unauthenticated attempts are blocked with a clear sign-in prompt or redirect.


## Interaction
- [X] IX-16: Attempting to register an existing email produces immediate, visible duplicate-account feedback and keeps the registration form available for correction.

- [X] IX-17: Search results and the available-item count update as the buyer types or clears a query, without requiring a separate search submission.

- [X] IX-18: Changing any available filter or sort choice immediately updates the displayed listings and result count, and clearing all filters restores the unfiltered available listings.

- [X] IX-19: Adding a listing to the cart produces immediate visible confirmation and updates the cart count, line item, and total without a manual reload.


## Content
- [X] CT-20: Each listing's details present its photos, title, description, price, category, condition, location, seller, listing date, availability, and upcycled status consistently with the listing data.
