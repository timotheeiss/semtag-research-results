# Test Result

## Functionality
- [X] FT-1: The document list identifies each document's module; choosing a module shows only documents from that module, and choosing all modules restores the complete list.

- [X] FT-2: Selecting a document displays its title, description, version and update date, content sections, and related documents.

- [X] FT-3: From an expanded content section or the related-documents list, choosing a valid document reference makes the referenced document the visible document.

- [X] FT-4: Collapsing an expanded content section hides that section's body and expanded reference links while leaving the section available to reopen.

- [X] FT-5: Expanding a collapsed content section restores that section's body and any reference links it contains.

- [X] FT-6: Users can select a knowledge-graph node and receive a visible selection indication, and can change the graph zoom and reset the graph view with visible zoom feedback.

- [X] FT-7: The knowledge graph represents every available document across all modules and their related-document connections, and its view controls allow the complete graph to be brought into view.

- [X] FT-8: The application provides Documents, Knowledge Graph, and Favorites views, and users can switch among all three.

- [X] FT-9: Switching among Documents, Knowledge Graph, and Favorites preserves the selected document, each section's expanded or collapsed state, and the graph's zoom and pan state.

- [ ] FT-10: Favorites are retained after reload, their navigation count updates immediately, their markers survive document filtering and sorting, and the Favorites view continues to expose every favorited document regardless of a module filter used in Documents.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Favorites view incorrectly inherits the Documents module filter
    - Actual: Favoriting 2 API docs updated count to 2 immediately, persisted after reload, and markers survived search/sort on Documents. However, when Documents module filter was set to 'AUTH' (excluding both favorited API docs) then switching to Favorites tab, the Favorites view showed 'No favorites yet' despite count=2. Resetting Documents filter to 'All' and returning to Favorites restored the 2 favorited items. This violates the requirement that Favorites expose every favorited document regardless of the Documents module filter.


## Constraint
- [X] CS-12: A document never lists itself as either a content-section reference or a related document.

- [X] CS-13: The knowledge graph contains one node for every available document, associates each node with the document's module, and draws connections for the available related-document relationships.


## Interaction
- [X] IX-15: Each content section has a clear collapsed or expanded indicator, and the indicator's state agrees with whether the section body and expanded links are visible.

- [ ] IX-16: Choosing a document node in the knowledge graph opens that document in the document view without requiring a separate tab change, while preserving the graph view for later return.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Clicking a knowledge-graph node does not open the document view
    - Actual: Clicking (single, repeated, and double-click) the 'REST API Design Guidelines' graph node only toggled its selection state ('selected') but never navigated to or displayed the document view; doc.title element never appeared while on the Graph tab.

- [X] IX-17: Choosing a reference link shown for a collapsed section leaves the current document open and displays a prompt to expand the section; after expansion, choosing the same link opens its target document.

- [X] IX-18: When search or module criteria match no documents, the document list displays a clear no-results message, and clearing those criteria restores matching documents.
