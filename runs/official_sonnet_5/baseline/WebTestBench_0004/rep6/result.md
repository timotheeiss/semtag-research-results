# Test Result

## Functionality
- [X] FT-1: Couples can create their locally saved wedding dashboard by entering both partner names, a future wedding date, a positive budget, and a non-negative whole-number guest count; the saved values are shown on the dashboard.

- [X] FT-2: Couples can reopen their wedding details, change any saved partner name, date, budget, or guest count, save the changes, and see the updated values on the dashboard.

- [X] FT-3: Users can filter venues by venue type and price range and vendors by service type and price range, individually or in combination; clearing the criteria restores the full corresponding list.

- [X] FT-4: Keyword search matches relevant venue and vendor information, including names, descriptions, locations, and vendor specialties, without case sensitivity and updates the visible results and count.

- [X] FT-5: Users can add or remove any venue or vendor from their favorites and view the current favorite venues and vendors together in the saved-favorites area.

- [X] FT-6: Users can browse planning checklists by category, open a checklist, and view every task with its explanatory guidance.

- [X] FT-7: Users can save or unsave a whole planning checklist and the dashboard updates its saved-checklist count and preview accordingly.


## Constraint
- [ ] CS-8: The dashboard accepts only a positive numeric wedding budget; zero, negative, empty, or otherwise invalid values are rejected without replacing the previously saved budget.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Zero budget accepted without validation
    - Actual: Setting budget to 0 and saving was accepted; dashboard now displays Budget: $0, replacing the previously saved $45,000 value, instead of being rejected.

- [ ] CS-9: The dashboard accepts only a non-negative whole-number guest count; negative or fractional values are rejected without replacing the previously saved count.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Negative guest count accepted without validation
    - Actual: Setting Expected Guests to -5 and saving was accepted; dashboard now displays Guest Count: -5, replacing the previously saved value of 200, instead of being rejected.

- [X] CS-10: Favorite venues, favorite vendors, and saved checklists remain available after navigating away and after reloading the application.

- [ ] CS-11: A saved wedding date must be a valid future calendar date; current or past dates are rejected without replacing the previously saved date.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Past wedding date accepted without validation
    - Actual: Setting wedding date to 2020-01-01 (a past date) and saving was accepted; dashboard now displays 'Jan 1, 2020' and the 'days until your special day' countdown text disappeared, instead of the past date being rejected.


## Interaction
- [ ] IX-12: Users can open any venue or vendor listing to view its complete details.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Listing detail view does not open
    - Actual: Clicking 'View Details' on a venue card (Rosewood Garden Estate) and 'View Profile' on a vendor card (Eternal Moments Photography) produced no navigation, no modal, and no expanded detail content. The page URL and DOM remained unchanged (verified via DOM query for dialog/modal elements, which returned none) and no console errors were logged.

- [X] IX-13: Users can mark and unmark checklist tasks; the checklist percentage updates immediately, aggregate dashboard progress updates accordingly, and completion state remains after reload.

- [X] IX-14: Visible venue or vendor results and their count update immediately as search or filter criteria change, without a separate submit action; clearing all criteria restores the full list.

- [ ] IX-19: If a user changes wedding details and selects Cancel, the saved dashboard values remain unchanged and reopening the editor shows the last saved values rather than the cancelled draft.
  - Bug Report:
    - Issue: Cancel does not discard draft form state
    - Actual: After changing Budget to 99999 and clicking Cancel, the dashboard correctly kept showing $30,000. However, reopening the 'Update Details' editor showed the Budget field pre-filled with the cancelled draft value 99999 instead of the last saved value 30000.


## Content
- [X] CT-15: After valid wedding details are saved, the dashboard displays the couple's names, formatted wedding date, budget, guest count, planning progress, favorite counts or previews, and saved-checklist counts or previews.

- [X] CT-16: Each venue and vendor listing presents its name, location, category or service type, price range, rating, and summary; venues also show guest capacity and vendors show offered specialties.

- [X] CT-17: The checklist collection covers planning, ceremony, reception, attire, and honeymoon topics, with at least one checklist per category and a title and explanatory description for every task.

- [X] CT-18: When search and filter criteria are combined, every visible result satisfies all active criteria, the displayed result count is accurate, a clear no-match state appears for zero results, and clearing restores the full list.
